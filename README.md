# Flutter E-Commerce App


A simple Flutter-based e-commerce app designed as an interview project, demonstrating a clean architecture using the Flutter BLoC state management approach. This app includes essential screens for login, products listing, and product details.

# Features
Login Page: User authentication page for secure access.
Products Screen: Displays a list of available products with thumbnail images, prices, and brief descriptions fetched from REST API end points.
Product Details Screen: Shows detailed information for a selected product, including high-resolution images, description, and pricing details.
